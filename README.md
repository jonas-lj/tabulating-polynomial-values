Tabulating Polynomial Values
---

This is an implementation in Rust of an algorithm by Knuth ("Art of Computer Programming" section 4.6.4) which can compute evaluations of a polynomial on points in arithmetic progression.
When the number of points is (sufficiently) greater than the degree of the polynomial, this method is quicker.
